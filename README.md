# Nixos configuration

## Author

## Objective

This repository contains the configuration I use for my [Framework Laptop](https://frame.work).

## Disclaimer
I'm a beginner with Nix/NixOs : you should not copy anything until you really understand it because I'm not sure this is neither the good way nor the correct way to do it.

Moreover, this is a work in progress and tailored for my usages.

## TODO

- [ ] SSH Configuration
- [ ] Disable Klipper
